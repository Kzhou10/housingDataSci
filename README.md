# Rental Housing Price Analysis: Vancouver vs. Calgary

## Project Overview

This project investigates rental housing prices in two major Canadian citiesâ€”**Vancouver** and **Calgary**. The goal is to explore market differences and identify key factors that contribute to rental price variations. Vancouver is known for its high cost of living and limited housing supply, while Calgary offers more affordable options driven by different economic factors. Understanding the dynamics between these cities can help inform public policy, urban planning, and investment decisions.
